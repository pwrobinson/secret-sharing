Implementation of an (`m`,`n`)-threshold secret sharing scheme.
A given ByteString `b` (the secret) is split into `n` shares,
and any `m` shares are sufficient to reconstruct `b`.
The scheme preserves information-theoretic perfect secrecy in the sense that the knowledge of up
to `m-1` shares does not reveal any information about the secret `b`.

*Example in GHCi:*
Suppose that you want to split the string "my secret data" into n=5 shares such that
at least m=3 shares are necessary to reconstruct the secret.

> $ :m + Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 Crypto.SecretSharing
> $ let secret = pack "my secret message!"
> $ shares <- encode 3 5 secret
> $ mapM_ (Prelude.putStrLn . show) shares -- each share should be deposited at a different site.

> $ let shares' = Prelude.drop 2 shares
> $ decode shares'
